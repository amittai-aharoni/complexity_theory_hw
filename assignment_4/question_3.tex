    Let  $P_{nu}$ be the class of all decision 
    problems $L \subseteq \{0, 1\}^*$ 
    such that for each $n \in \N$, 
    the problem $L \cap \{0, 1\}^n$ 
    is polynomial-time solvable. 
    That is, for each $n \in \N$, 
    there exists a deterministic TM $M_n$ 
    and a constant $c_n$ such that 
    $M_n$ decides $L \cap \{0, 1\}^n$ and 
    runs in time $O(n^{c_n})$.
    \par In this exercise, you will show that $P_{nu}$
    is different from $P/poly$. 
    \par You may opt for an easy variant (A) of this
    exercise, for a total maximum of 11/2 points,
    or a harder variant (B) of this exercise,
    for a total maximum of 2 points.
    \par (A) Prove that if $P_{nu} = P/poly$, 
    then the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.
    \par (B) Prove that $P_{nu} \neq P/poly$.
    \par Hint: for (B), have a look at Sections 6.5 and 6.6 from the book [1].
